# Whale Tracker & Trading Bot - Troubleshooting Guide

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Installation Issues

**Q: I'm getting dependency errors when installing the requirements. What should I do?**
A: Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or newer. Try installing dependencies individually:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   pip install ccxt
   pip install requests
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

**Q: The bot won't run after installation. What's wrong?**
A: Check these common issues:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify your config.json file has proper JSON formatting
   - Make sure you have the correct directory structure
   - Check if you have the required permissions to access API keys

### 2. Configuration Questions

**Q: How do I set up Telegram alerts?**
A: You need to:
   1. Create a Telegram bot using @BotFather
   2. Get your bot token from BotFather
   3. Create a group and add your bot to it
   4. Get the chat ID by sending a message and checking https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   5. Add these to config.json:
      ```json
      "alerts": {
          "telegram": {
              "bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
              "chat_id": "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
          }
      }
      ```

**Q: What should I set the whale thresholds to?**
A: The default thresholds are good starting points:
   - ETH: 100 ETH (approximately $350,000)
   - SOL: 50,000 SOL (approximately $5 million)
   - BTC: 500 BTC (approximately $32 million)
   
   Adjust based on the market cap and typical whale sizes for each blockchain.

**Q: How do I customize alert rules?**
A: Add rules to the "custom_alert_rules" section in config.json:
   ```json
   "custom_alert_rules": [
       {
           "token": "ETH",
           "min_amount": 200,
           "transaction_type": "sell"
       }
   ]
   ```
   This example will only alert on ETH transactions of 200+ ETH that are sells.

### 3. Whale Detection Issues

**Q: The bot isn't detecting any whale transactions. What's wrong?**
A: Check these issues:
   - Verify your API keys are correct in config.json
   - Ensure blockchain APIs are working (Etherscan, Solscan)
   - Check if your whale thresholds are set too high
   - Wait longer - whale transactions don't happen constantly

**Q: Can I track specific wallets even if they're not whales?**
A: Yes, add them to your wallets.csv file with a high risk_score (8-10):
   ```
   address,label,last_activity,risk_score,category
   0xYourWalletAddress,Important Wallet,2023-07-01T00:00:00,9.0,custom
   ```

### 4. Trading Bot Questions

**Q: How do I connect to exchanges for actual trading?**
A: Add your exchange API keys to config.json:
   ```json
   "api_keys": {
       "binance": {
           "api_key": "YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY",
           "api_secret": "YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET"
       }
   }
   ```
   Make sure your API keys have trading permissions.

**Q: How can I test the trading features without risking funds?**
A: Use the `--track-only` flag when running the bot, or use test scripts:
   ```
   python src/test_trading.py
   ```

**Q: Can I override the risk adjustment for specific trading pairs?**
A: Not directly in the current version. You can modify trade_executor.py to add
   special handling for specific pairs in the adjust_risk_based_on_whale_activity method.

### 5. Performance and Scaling

**Q: Will this bot work with thousands of wallets?**
A: Yes, but you might need to optimize:
   - Use a more efficient database backend than CSV files
   - Increase the polling interval (monitoring.whale_polling_seconds)
   - Consider using a dedicated server for better performance

**Q: How much data will this store over time?**
A: By default, all whale transactions are stored in CSV files. This can grow large over time.
   Consider implementing data retention policies or switching to a database with better scaling.

### 6. Advanced Features

**Q: Can I add support for more blockchains?**
A: Yes, you'll need to:
   1. Add a new detector class similar to EthereumDetector in whale_detector.py
   2. Add appropriate API keys in config.json
   3. Set appropriate whale thresholds for the new blockchain

**Q: How can I deploy this in production?**
A: For production use:
   - Set up proper logging to a file
   - Consider using a process manager like Supervisor or PM2
   - Set up proper monitoring and alerts for the bot itself
   - Create regular backups of your data files
